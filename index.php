        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p id="website_content">Barley, founded in 2004, is China's comprehensive on-site entertainment ticketing marketing platform, business covering concert, drama, musical, sports events and other fields.
On March 21, 2017, alibaba group announced that it has completed the wholly-owned purchase of China's largest performance ticketing platform, barley net.</br></br>
This means that barley net has been officially added into the strategic section of ali university culture and entertainment, which helps the major sections of culture and entertainment to achieve coordinated development through offline content delivery and channel access services.
On September 19, 2017, barley was upgraded to the live entertainment business group of alibaba culture and entertainment group, and the new brand image and positioning were started, and the new slogan of "go to the site and be the beloved" was proposed.
